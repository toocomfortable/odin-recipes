    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p> Salmon filets are stuffed with a flavorful mixture of Mediterranean ingredients, 
        including sun-dried tomatoes, artichokes, spinach, and feta; then they're pan fried to perfection in this 
        flavor-packed fish dish that looks and tastes fantastic.</p> 
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <u1> 
     <li> 4 (8 ounce) Salmon fillets </li> 
     <li> 4 cups chopped fresh spinach</li>
     <li> 1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, drained and chopped</li>
     <li> 1/2 cup artichoke hearts, drained and chopped</li>
     <li> 1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
     <li> 1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste </li>
     <li> salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </u1>

    <h2> Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> <p> Make a horizontal slice in the center of each salmon fillet but do not cut all the way through.</p> </li>
        <li> <p> Fill a large bowl with ice and cold water. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add spinach and cook uncovered until tender, about 40 seconds. Drain in a colander and immediately immerse in ice water for several minutes to stop the cooking process. Drain thoroughly and transfer to a bowl.</p> </li>
        <li> <p> Add sun-dried tomatoes, artichokes, and feta cheese to the blanched spinach; mix to combine. Divide evenly and stuff into the salmon "pockets." Season fillets with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. </p> </li>
        <li> <p> Heat a cast iron skillet over medium heat. Place salmon fillets, skin-sides down, in the hot skillet and sear for 5 minutes. Gently flip and sear the other sides for 5 minutes. Flip again to finish cooking, about 5 minutes more. </p> </li>

    </ol>
